            <h3 className='discription'>Nighttime Drinks is the world’s best cocktail resource, with over 3500 amazing recipes and a growing community of cocktail-making enthusiasts from around the world.

It was founded in 2010 when cocktail enthusiast and software developer Nick Wilkins became fed up browsing the web trying to find decent cocktail recipes.

Over two months, he built his own website from scratch, taking ideas from cocktail-loving friends and coming up with the pioneering My Bar feature. Nighttime Drinks was born.

The site has grown ever since, undergoing several redesigns but always doing what it set out to do all those years ago — to help people have fun while making the best cocktails they can.</h3>
